<h1>Weather Dashboard Challenge</h1>

## In this challenge, we are leverage key concepts in Server Side APIs.

## We are leveraging Open Weather to query data from various cities. Upon typing in a city name, we are presented with current weather and a five day forecast.

## In addtion to querying key data from the current city, we are saving the city name to local storage and displaying historical results. 

## Once we click on the historical searches, then you are presented with the relevant data.
